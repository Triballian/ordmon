Certain sites do not like being scraped, to get around this python needs to pretend to be a browser.
You need to download the program chrome driver http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
I use 2.9 win32
just place chromedriver.exe into the same directory as gormonsel.exe
Instructions:

Select the site
click the Open Log Page button
login to the site, if you haven't logged on for awhile
click the Log Page button again, if you are logged in you will see your trade logs
click on Start Monitoring button, you can use the browser normablly as long as you don't use 
the first tab being run by the app. When a trade occurs an alarm will sound, click on 
stop alarm to shut of the alarm sound.


any questions or comments you can contact me at: 
noe@stakeco.in

To fix:
The app throws an exception when not in the correct website, this is a user error because it can only work on the trading log page but I can eliminate that as a bug.
